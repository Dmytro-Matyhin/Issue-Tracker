# Issue Tracker

This is a simple IssueTracker to works with issues. I used [expressjs.com](https://expressjs.com/) to make a server and [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) to create a database (by [typicode](https://github.com/typicode)).

## Installation

1. Install packages in root folder of your project
   
```
cd [your project folder name]
npm install
```
2. Go to the **server** folder and install server packages

```
cd server
npm install
```

## Run

1. In root folder run this command. It will open localhost in the browser. 
   
```
npm run dev
```
2. In **server** folder run this command. It will activate the server.
```
npm run start
```

## Additional Information

By default, **db.json** file contains a few users. Later I will the add ability to add users to the Database and UI.
